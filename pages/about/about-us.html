              The School is set up to attain the twin goals of academic
              excellence as well as meeting the manpower requirements of the
              National Economy. The educational objectives will be seen largely
              in the Institution's attempt to produce competent professionals,

            <span class="section-badge">Since 1908</span>
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem">Historical Background</h2>

            <div class="content-text">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
                The School was founded on <strong>1st July, 1908</strong> as a
                Government Department Training Institution attached to the
                Colonial Survey Department in Lagos for the Training of
                Technical Assistants. It later moved from Lagos to Ibadan in
                1926 and later to Oyo in 1934.
              </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
                When regionisation came and surveying was no longer in the
                exclusive list, the School was split into two. One belonged to
                Federal Surveys and the other maintained by the then Western
                Region Survey Department. This arrangement continued till 1965
                when the Federal School then located at Okene had a storm
                disaster. The Federal Students were then relocated to the
                Western Regional School still at Oyo.
              </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
                With this co-habitation, the Federal Surveys Department
                continued to support the School with Staff and materials
                (instruments and funds inclusive) until 1976. In that year, the
                Western Region, then known as Western State was split into three
                states; Oyo, Ogun and Ondo States and the proprietorship of the
                school was transferred to Federal Surveys again.
              </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
                For about 80 years of its existence, the school was running
                programmes only in Land Surveying. In January 1989, the Federal
                Survey School of Photogrammetry and Cartography earlier based at
                Ebute-Metta, Lagos was transferred to Oyo and merged with the
                School. In effect, from 1989, the school started to run Basic
                (Later Intermediate) and Advanced Certificate Programmes in
                Photogrammetry and Cartography.
              </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
                The School had also changed its name at various times. It had
                been known as "Survey School", "School of Surveying", "Federal
                Survey School" and finally by virtue of
                <strong>Decree 19 of 1990</strong> it was established as
                <strong>"Federal School of Surveying"</strong>.
